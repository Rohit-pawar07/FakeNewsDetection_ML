# FakeNewsDetection_ML
With the growing popularity of mobile technology and social media, information is accessible at oneâ€™s fingertips. Mobile applications and social media platforms have over-thrown traditional print media in the dissemination of news and information. With the outburst of information, it is seemingly tedious for a layman to distinguish whether the news he consumes is real or fake. Fake news is typically published with an intent to mislead or create bias to acquire political or financial gains. Hence it may tend to have luring headlines or interesting content to increase viewership.In this project we have attempted to implement two out of these algorithms to train and test our results. We have used a combination of both off the shelf datasets as well as expanded it by crawling content on the web. The main challenge throughout the project has been to build a set of uniform clean data and to tune parameters of our algorithms to attain the maximum accuracy
